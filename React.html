  <h1>What is React?</h1>
	
	<p>React is a JavaScript library. It is used to make a web page interactive. It was created by Facebook in 2013 and originally used for their news feed.<br><br> Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM, where it does all the necessary manipulating. This means that the whole page doesn't need rendering, just the parts that actually changed, which makes the performance of the entire page a lot better.

	<p>React is a free and open-source library which means that anyone can use, copy and improve the software. Read more about open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
